Analyzing Bike Sales Trends Across Regions
I identify key factors influencing bike sales in different regions (Europe, Pacific Ocean, and North America) and understand customer demographics.
The dataset includes bike sales data across three regions, along with customer information such as education, commute, age, occupation, income, and gender.
I used Excel to analyzed the data, uncover trends and correlations between bike sales and customer demographics. Which includes regions with higher average income tend to have higher bike sales and customers with higher education levels are more likely to purchase bikes.
The analysis revealed regional differences in bike sales are influenced by income and occupation also commute type is a significant factor in bike sales, majorly age factor determined by their gender also helped to visualize the move of sales
Excel was used for data analysis and visualization, whcih help the project demonstrates my ability to analyze complex data, identify trends, and provide actionable insights that can inform business decisions.
